## Description

This repository documents a **supervised machine learning project** focused on predicting the age of crabs based on their physical and morphological characteristics. The main objective of the project is to understand and apply the complete machine learning workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and performance evaluation.

The project is developed as part of a **self-directed learning process**, prioritizing sound technical decision-making, result interpretation, and an understanding of the limitations of each model used.

## Version 1 (Baseline Model)

In this first version, a **linear regression model** is used as a baseline. This approach allows for validating the consistency of the dataset and establishing a reference point for comparison with more complex models.

Although the results are limited, this step provides valuable insights into the data and confirms the need for more expressive models.

## Project Evolution

The project is continuously evolving. Future versions will incorporate:

- Nonlinear regression models  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Additional evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE)  

The goal is to improve predictive performance and deepen the analysis of the problem.
